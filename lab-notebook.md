# Experiment 1 Day 5, Analysis
At 3:30pm, the bunches in each cup were weighed again and
the weights were recorded. Bunches which were treated
with water were patted dry with a paper towel before weighing.
After weighing the plants from each cup, the plants were
presented in a random order to two judges (Filippo and Josh)
to assess the freshness of the herbs by scoring each one
one a scale from 1 to 5. The judging was conducted blind-
Ethan performed the randomization and presented the
herbs to the judges without indicating the treament for
each plant. Ethan also weighed all the plants so that
the judges had not seen the plants at the end of the
experiment prior to judging.

There was one error in carrying out the randomization
for judging.
The order specified by the generated random sequence
indicated that the plant material from pot 2 which
received treatment 1 should have been presented
to the judges 4th, while the plant material from
pot 2 which received treatment 2 should have been
presented 6th. The order of these two were accidentally
swapped so that the plant material from pot 2 which
received treatment 2 was presented 4th and the plant
material from pot 2 which received treatment 1 was
presented 6th.

# Started experiment 2 on Wednesday, Oct 22, 2025

# Day 0: Oct 22, 10:00pm
3 pots of basil were purchased from Meijer.
From each pot, stems were trimmed and the 8
largest stems from each pot were retained
for the experiment. Each stem was placed
into a cup with a label to uniquely identify it
and specify which pot the stem was from.
Some cups would additionally recieve water, up
to a 2 cm line marked from the bottom of the cup.

The water treatments were randomly assigned such
that for each pot, four cups (stems) were randomly
chosen for treatment. The code conducting this
randomization is available in exp2_randomize.py

After filling all cups with water and labeling the
cups with their treatment assignment, 2 pictures
were taken of each cup, 1 facing the cup and 1
above the cup.

The cups were then arranged in a 3x8 grid on
a table where each row contained cups with
stems from the same pot.

# Day 1: Oct 23

Photos were taken of all cups at about 6:00pm, both facing the cup
and from above. Cups were returned to the same
3x8 arrangement on the table.

# Day 2: Oct 24

Photos were taken of all cups at about 6:00pm, both facing the cup
and from above. Cups were returned to the same
3x8 arrangement on the table.

# Day 3: Oct 25

Photos were taken of all cups at about 6:30pm, both facing the cup
and from above. Cups were placed on trays and moved to a different
location for a day.

# Day 4: Oct 26

Photos were taken of all cups at about 10:00pm, both facing the cup
and from above. Cups were returned to the table.

# Day 5: Oct 27

Photos were taken of all cups at about 5:00pm, both facing the cup
and from above. After the images were taken, the cups were weighed
with the plants inside. Cups which were assigned the water treatment
had the water poured out, and the plant was patted dry. The inside
of the cup was also dried before returning the plant to the cup
and weighing. Afterwards, the cups were transported to a crate
and taken to meet with the judges for the second freshness test.

For the freshness test, all three judges participated (Filippo,
Mihir, and Josh), and the plants were presented to the three
judges in a random order without revealing the treatment
assigned to that plant. The judges each provided a freshness
score between 1 and 5. There was one instance where the
order of the plants was accidentally swapped, these were the
plants from pot 4, plant 7 and pot4, plant 8.
